# Feature Complete Skill

## When to use

Invoke with `/feature-complete` **from inside a feature worktree** (`../MPS_NG-<name>` or
`../MPS-TRM-<name>`, on branch `feat/<name>`) when a screen is finished and ready to land.
It commits, rebases onto `master` (resolving conflicts with this screen's context),
fast-forward-merges into `master`, then shuts down this slot's dev servers, removes the
worktree, and deletes the branch.

Deploy is a **separate** step — after this completes, run `/mps_deploy` if you want to ship.

The merge is always a clean fast-forward because we rebase first. Conflicts are resolved
HERE (you have the context), so `master` only ever sees a fast-forward.

## Project-aware

This worktree is either **MPS_NG** or **MPS-TRM**. Detect which from the repo (web package
name — `@mps/web` for NG, `@mps-trm/web` for TRM) and substitute throughout:

| | MPS_NG | MPS-TRM |
|---|---|---|
| Main checkout | `C:\dev\etsmalterre\MPS_NG` | `C:\dev\etsmalterre\MPS-TRM` |
| Web package | `@mps/web` | `@mps-trm/web` |
| API package | `@mps/api` | *(none — skip API steps)* |
| Merge-log file | `claude_doc/worktree-merge-log.md` | *(none — skip if absent)* |

Below, **`<MAIN>`** = the main checkout for this project. Get it programmatically with
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` (its parent dir is `<MAIN>`).

## Preconditions

- You are in a feature worktree on a `feat/*` branch (NOT the main checkout / `master`).
- `<MAIN>` is on `master` with a clean working tree. (The `apps/api/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`
  gitignore keeps it clean across builds — if `git -C <MAIN> status --porcelain` is
  non-empty, resolve that first; do not force past it.)

## Steps

1. **Confirm the branch.** `git branch --show-current` must be `feat/<name>`. If not, STOP.

2. **Write the note + final commit.** Review the full diff. Craft a thorough summary of what
   this screen does — this is the **note**, used as the merge-commit message. If the project
   has a merge log (`claude_doc/worktree-merge-log.md` — NG only), prepend a dated entry
   (newest first). Commit any remaining work plus the log entry on the branch. End the commit
   body with:
   ```
   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

3. **Push the branch** (ensure the account first):
   ```bash
   gh auth switch --user vincentmalterre
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

4. **Rebase onto the latest master, resolving conflicts here:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/master
   ```
   On conflict: edit, `git add`, `git rebase --continue` (keep BOTH sides on additive
   registry files; for `claude_doc/worktree-merge-log.md` keep every entry). Then:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

5. **Typecheck gate — do not merge broken code.**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @mps/web exec tsc --noEmit        # (or @mps-trm/web on TRM) — MUST be clean
   pnpm --filter @mps/api exec tsc --noEmit        # NG only — only the 7 known baseline errors
   ```
   On NG the API has 7 pre-existing baseline errors in `src/lib/hfsql.ts` + `src/scripts/*`;
   the gate passes if web is clean AND no API error references a file you changed. On TRM there
   is no API package, but the web typecheck has **2 pre-existing baseline errors** (implicit-any
   in `Header.tsx` + `MobileNav.tsx`) — the gate passes if the only errors are those two AND
   none reference a file you changed. If anything else fails, fix it before continuing.

6. **Fast-forward merge into master, from the main checkout (`<MAIN>`):**
   ```bash
   git -C <MAIN> fetch origin
   git -C <MAIN> status --porcelain          # must be empty — else stop & resolve
   git -C <MAIN> merge --ff-only origin/master
   git -C <MAIN> merge --ff-only feat/<name>
   git -C <MAIN> push origin master
   ```
   - If `merge --ff-only feat/<name>` **fails** (another feature landed on master between your
     rebase and now), re-run step 4 (`git fetch && git rebase origin/master && git push
     --force-with-lease`) then retry step 6. The `--ff-only` guard is intentional — it refuses
     to create a tangled merge.

7. **Tear down** — run from the main checkout dir (`<MAIN>`):
   ```bash
   cd <MAIN> && node scripts/worktree/down.mjs <name> --remove
   ```
   (The worktree scripts live in the **MPS_NG** checkout. For a TRM worktree, run the script
   from MPS_NG — it resolves the TRM repo from the registry entry — i.e.
   `cd /c/dev/etsmalterre/MPS_NG && node scripts/worktree/down.mjs <name> --remove`.)
   This stops the slot's API + web process trees, frees the slot, and removes the worktree +
   branch. **Expected on Windows:** because this very session (and your terminal) is still
   cwd'd inside the worktree, the OS won't let the directory be deleted — so the script
   **defers** the dir/branch removal to a pending queue and prints a NOTE. That's fine: the
   merge is already done and the slot is freed. The leftover dir is reaped **automatically**
   the next time any worktree skill runs from the main checkout (or `node
   scripts/worktree/reap.mjs` there after you close this session).

8. **Report.** Confirm: merged to `master` (show `git -C <MAIN> log --oneline -3`) and
   slot freed. State whether the worktree dir was removed now or deferred (per the script's
   output). Tell the user to **close this Claude session / terminal** — the work is on `master`,
   and any deferred dir cleans itself up on the next worktree skill. Shipping is a separate
   `/mps_deploy` from the main checkout.
